    """encoding categorical features with wighted target value
    
    samples with value X of a categorical feature are encoded with value (cur_mean * K + alpha * overall_mean) / (K + alpha):
        cur_mean - mean target for samples with value X for current feature
        overall_mean - mean target of overall dataset
        K - number of occurences of value X of current feature
        alpha - parameter, the larger it is, the more occurences of feature value is needed to be encoded significantly different from overall mean target  
    simple scheme means make target encoding for validation parts bases on train parts (simple out-of-fold technique)
    not simple scheme means make target encoding for train part based on k-fold split inside it (using inner_folds)
